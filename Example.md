# TODO

- Finish writing the document
- Only retaining the raw HTML for the body section of the document

## Stretch goals

- Document language
- API Access to ArcGIS dataset

### Secondary stretch goals

- Using WordPress API to update a post?
  - E.g., `http://web.sas.upenn.edu/access-map/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/` works for *reading* pages Not sure about updating pages yet, though a `PUT` command should work for it.
